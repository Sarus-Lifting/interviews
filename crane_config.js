// First Question: After seeing a load chart, how would you structure the load chart data? (First 3 rows only)

// Implement a function that takes the maximum operating radius and the load chart data you just created
// and returns the length of the boom that will provide the greated capacity

function getStrongestConfiguration(maxOperatingRadius, loadChart) {
    // your code here
}
